# RightScale MySQL Database Cookbook

## DESCRIPTION:

Provides the MySQL implementation of the 'db' resource to install and manage
MySQL database stand-alone servers and clients.

## REQUIREMENTS:

* Requires a server launched from a RightScale managed RightImage.

## COOKBOOKS DEPENDENCIES:

Please see `metadata.rb` file for the latest dependencies.

## KNOWN LIMITATIONS:

There are no known limitations.

## SETUP:

* To setup only the database client, place `db::default` recipe into
  your runlist. This will pull in generic client inputs, provide provider
  selection input and install client. Set db/provider_type input in
  RightScale ServerTemplate to set provider and version for 'db' resource.
* To setup a MySQL database client and server, place the following recipes
  in order to your runlist:

    db_mysql::setup_server_<version>
      loads the MySQL provider, tuning parameters, as well as other
      MySQL-specific attributes into the node as inputs.

    db::install_server
      sets up generic server and client inputs. This will also include
      db::default recipe which installs the client.

  For example: To set up and install MySQL 5.5 client and server

    db_mysql::setup_server_5_5
    db::install_server

## USAGE:

### Basic usage

Once setup, use the recipes in the 'db' cookbook to install and manage your
MySQL database servers and clients. See the `db/README.md` for usage details.

### MySQL Tuning and my.cnf

Custom tuning parameters can be applied by overriding the `my.cnf.erb`
template or by setting the values in the attributes file. For more information
and an example override repository, please see: [Override Chef Cookbooks][CCDG].

## DETAILS:

### General

The 'db' implementation is defined by a Lightweight Provider, which can be
found in the `providers/default.rb` file.

The ‘read_only’ flag in the MySQL configuration is set by the definition
`db_mysql_set_read_only`. This flag is set to ‘false’ by default
and changed to ‘true’ while initializing a slave server, and set back to
‘false’ when the slave is promoted to a master server.

### Attributes:

These are settings used in recipes and templates. Default values are noted.

Note: Only "internal" cookbook attributes are described here. Descriptions of
attributes which have inputs can be found in the metadata.rb cookbook file. For
generic db attributes, refer to the db cookbook readme.
